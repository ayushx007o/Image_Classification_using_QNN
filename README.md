# Image_Classification_using_QNN

This repository contains an image classification project utilizing a hybrid Quanvolutional Neural Network (QNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The hybrid model combines quantum convolution (quanvolution) and classical convolution to achieve efficient classification
